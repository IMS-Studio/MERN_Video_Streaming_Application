# MERN_Video_Streaming_Application
ZippyTube

Video streaming SPA that is built by using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) 

Built by using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. For the UI development process,
I have implemented a bottom-up approach to promote the UI components' reusability.
I have used several React-specific techniques, such as Container Component and Higher-Order
Component to avoid duplications of code. I have integrated Material UI to not only
streamline the UI development process but also to fast-track the front-end development
process.

For the back-end development, I have utilized a microservices architecture to encapsulate
every feature to promote the application's scalability. I have implemented the
middleware called the http-proxy for a reverse proxy, which is an essential feature to
redirect users to the designated endpoints
### Motivation
The primary motivation behind the creation of this project was to gain a better understanding of integrating a microservices architecture into a web application. Since I was interested in building a video-streaming application with React, I decided to develop my own app using a microservice architecture.
### Technologies
* <strong>React</strong> for frontend development library
* <strong>Express</strong> for backend development framework
* <strong>Node.js</strong> for runtime environment
* <strong>MongoDB</strong> for NoSQL DBMS
* <strong>Redis</strong> for distributed cache system
* <strong>Socket.io</strong> for the request response pattern
* <strong>PM2</strong> for production process manager and a load-balancer
